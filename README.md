### Hi there, my name is Blaire Baker!ðŸ‘‹

I am a software engineer by day, musical theatre performer by night!

When the COVID-19 pandemic put the entertainment industry at a standstill, I was determined to use this time to find another way to use my brain in a way I hadn't in quite some time. The journey led me to coding, where I fell in love with the dopamine rush of solving a tricky problem. I completed an immersive software engineering bootcamp at the Flatiron School, and am excited to continue my learning journey.

With my background in the arts, I bring immense creativity, the ability to empathize and take on the perspectives of others, and a laser-sharp focus to the table. 

I am passionate about bettering other peopleâ€™s lives and the world around us through code!

- I'm playing around with testing for the first time, and using my new knowledge of React hooks to create my portfolio website.
- Along with that, I am also taking a Data Structures & Algorithms course to get me in tip-top shape with Udemy.
- I'm looking to collaborate on projects surrounding social justice, climate change, and other work that aligns with my values.
- Fun fact: I am currently in SW Utah performing in Tuacahn Ampitheatre's 2021 Broadway season!
